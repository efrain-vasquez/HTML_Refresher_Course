          <h4>Section 1 - The Propriety of Action</h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          In Part I, "Of the Propriety of Action", Smith lays the groundwork for
          his moral theory by describing at length the sympathetic nature of
          human beings. People, Smith says, feel for other people based on
          imagining themselves in the positions of others -- what is called the
          imaginative capacity of sympathy. It is important to note that this
          capacity is based more on the situation someone is viewing than on the
          feelings of the person being viewed: you may see someone who is
          oblivious to the impropriety of his or her actions, but you will feel
          a sensation of embarrassment from imagining how you would feel if you
          were to commit such improprieties. Interestingly, Smith says that this
          is how our fear of death comes to be. Those who are dead have no sense
          of the tangible world, so they cannot in any way feel what it is like
          to have lost their lives; however, we superimpose our consciousness on
          the dead when we sympathize. We imagine how horrible such a loss would
          feel, even though we would not actually feel loss upon death. Smith
          says that this fear of death is one of the greatest societal
          safeguards against injustice, and he means by this that sympathy is
          responsible for the restraint of lethal force. We derive pleasure from
          sympathy with the sentiments of others, Smith says, because the
          concord of our own sentiments with those of another individual
          reinforces our own feelings and convictions. We are delighted to
          experience like-mindedness. On the other hand, there is nothing more
          jarring or upsetting than not being able to sympathize with someone
          else, because this lack of sympathy generates feelings of opposition.
          When the sympathy of the observer is perfect, the observer's
          sentiments are in concord with the sentiments of the person observed;
          it is from this concord that moral approbation arises. Disapprobation,
          similarly, comes from a complete absence of sympathy. Because other
          people are less interested in our affairs than we are, we often must
          temper our sentiments in order for other people to be able to
          sympathize with them. This is where the notion of propriety, the
          proper conduct of oneself in relation to society, comes from. What
          propriety demands of us varies widely based on specific circumstances,
          and based on what sort of passions we are experiencing. Smith
          classifies people's feelings, or passions, as follows: passions of the
          body; passions from habits of the imagination; unsocial passions;
          social passions; and selfish passions. Sympathy operates somewhat
          differently in the case of each class of passion. Passions of the body
          are very difficult to sympathize with, because they are based entirely
          on physical stimuli which the observer has no way of experiencing.
          Tempering sensations such as pain is therefore admirable, because
          observers know how difficult it is to temper pain, and consequently
          respect the sufferer for the self control expressed for propriety's
          sake. Passions from habit of the imagination are those which are only
          accessible through the unique experiences which a particular person
          has. Love is a major example of this. Though two people in love have
          cultivated through habit a powerful attachment to one another, their
          relationship is not accessible to even a sympathetic observer.
          Unsocial passions are those such as anger, hatred, and resentment, and
          are only accessible through sympathy when they seem justified. As a
          whole, they are disagreeable because, through sympathy, we feel fear
          for the persons against whom these passions are directed; it is only
          in cases of tempered resentment brought about by real injustice that
          one can approve of such sentiments. Social passions consist of
          sentiments such as generosity, humanity, and compassion. Just as we
          disagree with unsocial passions based on the fear we feel for their
          targets, we are most able to connect to these passions when we feel
          sympathy with their intended targets. Passions directed toward the
          self are joy and grief. Smith argues that it is easiest to sympathize
          with small joys and large griefs. It is easy to be happy for someone
          when a small goodness takes place, but large joy -- particularly an
          elevation in status -- excites envy in the observer and interferes
          with sympathy. On the other hand, a small grief is but a trifle, and
          observers are likely to see people who grieve over every little thing
          as having weak constitutions, whereas there is nothing more tragic
          than seeing someone who has lost everything -- particularly if this
          afflicted individual tempers his or her surely immense grief. We are
          more disposed to sympathize with joy than with sorrow, at least when
          envy does not interfere. This is because joy is much more agreeable
          for the sympathizer, and also because it is virtually impossible to
          fully enter into the pain of someone who has experienced true sorrow.
          This disposition towards joy leads us to admire the rich and powerful
          through sympathy with their apparent joy and ease in life; this is the
          origin of ambition. This is also why we almost worship the rich, and
          are so impressionable when it comes to the fashions and philosophies
          of the wealthy. People of low rank are willing to work tirelessly to
          cultivate skills and virtues, and to put themselves in any position
          where they can demonstrate these abilities and be acknowledged. In
          contrast, those in power will only take risks of great magnitude --
          for example, will initiate wars by which great glory may be gained.
          Unless the possible returns are that great, they will not put
          everything they already have at risk. Our admiration for the rich,
          Smith says, is a major source of moral corruption. As noted above, our
          admiration for them leads us to have a distorted view of morality,
          because we are liable to approve of almost anything that they do.
          Moreover, in seeking approval, we see our options as either being
          purely wise and virtuous, or being rich and high in status. Thus,
          though lower-class people who do not have easy access to wealth will
          happily work towards virtue, people in higher classes often sacrifice
          virtue for the easier path of being approved of purely as the result
          of status and wealth.
          <br />
          <br />
          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          It is useful to know that Smith is approaching moral theory from a
          school of thought which argues that moral philosophy is open to the
          methods of proof characteristic of other disciplines, such as math and
          science. Rather, this pedagogy argues, a theory of morality must be
          grounded in what resonates with innately human traits. Because
          morality is inherent to humanity, any theory of morality must be
          intuitively agreeable to us. So, as Smith presents his various
          examples and appeals to basic emotional knowledge, you should stop and
          ask yourself whether you can relate to his ideas, and whether his
          theory can explain experiences which you have actually had. (For more
          on how Smith views the accountability of moral philosophers, see
          312-313.) The most logically-accessible point in this first section is
          the fear of death. As Smith says, the actual concept of death cannot
          reasonably be feared in the way that most people fear it because, at
          the point of death, the world which is now so significant to us is no
          longer an imposition upon us. The argument that we are imagining what
          it would be like for us to be in the position of dying, though the
          concept is itself paradoxical, is emotionally intuitive. One could
          also consider in this framework the point that, when someone is dead,
          it is impossible for us to sympathize with him or her any longer
          because the person in question no longer exhibits agency. Since
          sympathy is our main way of relating to others, this could also
          explain why we fear death: it is a loss of the ability to be related
          to, and a severance of the bond the between self and others. One
          should also note that, to a certain degree, Smith's argument here
          presupposes some form of class distinction and division. Though such
          stratification appears inevitable in many societies today, and surely
          was present when Smith was writing, one should ask whether this has
          always been the situation. Before appreciable wealth was available, it
          is unclear whether ambition would have existed, since people would
          have had no wealthy upper-class models to aspire to or to imitate. It
          does not appear that Smith has a satisfactory response to these
          inquiries. Smith also never distinguishes between sympathy and
          empathy. Though one could argue that his idea of perfect concord
          between observer and agent is what we commonly call "empathy," it is
          more likely the case that Smith simply does not believe in empathy.
          His method of distinguishing between the self and others requires, in
          many respects, that we can never truly feel what someone else is
          feeling, a fact which is exacerbated when someone else experience
          acute sorrow. Yet we know some people to be what are called "empaths,"
          capable of deeply experiencing the emotions of others. This
          underscores an issue with Smith's philosophy which is entirely a
          product of the historical timeframe in which he is wrote: he
          presupposes relatively consistent psychology across all people. He
          points out routinely that his theory is mainly directed towards men,
          but what is not clearly stated is his assumption that different
          people, given the same series of relationships and experiences over
          their lives, will possess the same moral constitutions and act in the
          same ways. Again, in modern times, we can thank neuroscience and
          psychology for informing us that people's minds can be organized in
          radically different ways, an insight which renders a theory entirely
          based on how people mentally relate to others precarious.

          <h4>
            Section 2 - Merit and demerit: the objects of reward and punishment
          </h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          Part II, "Of Merit and Demerit; or, of the Objects of Reward and
          Punishment", considers what may be properly rewarded or punished. It
          introduces Smith's conception of justice, and differentiates justice
          from the other virtues, setting it aside as the basis of law. In
          particular, this section of Smith's book distinguishes between the two
          similar but distinct virtues of justice and beneficence. First, Smith
          discusses reward and punishment in the abstract. Reward, he says,
          naturally follows from the sentiment of gratitude; punishment
          naturally follows from resentment. Reward and punishment are like
          opposite sides of a single coin: gratitude and resentment are both
          sentiments brought about by someone acting upon us, and their
          difference depends on whether the act was positive or negative. In
          addressing the question of what may properly be rewarded or punished,
          Smith takes the logical next step: whatever is the proper object of
          gratitude ought to be rewarded, and whatever is the proper object of
          resentment ought to be punished. To determine what makes resentment or
          gratitude proper, Smith returns to the notion of sympathy: whatever
          resentment every impartial observer would find agreeable is proper,
          and the same is true of gratitude. This is nothing more than an
          extension of Smith's very definition of propriety. Smith emphasizes
          that this theory is contingent upon the propriety of whatever act of
          harm or beneficence led to gratitude or resentment. If an act of
          goodness was committed frivolously, we cannot approve of the gratitude
          of the person who was the object of the act. Similarly, if a supposed
          injury was committed with perfect propriety, as in a gentlemen's
          argument, we cannot enter into the sentiment of justifiable
          resentment. When taken in its totality, then, Smith's notion of the
          proper objects of punishment and reward is contingent on a combination
          of what he calls "direct sympathy" with the person who acts (the
          agent) and "indirect sympathy" with the person who is acted upon
          (75-77). Though reward and punishment seem similar, there is a
          significant difference between them: namely, reward follows an act of
          beneficence, and punishment follows a violation of justice.
          Beneficence must be given freely by definition and cannot in any
          justifiable way be enforced, whereas justice is the fundamental right
          of all and is enforceable by force. Justice is necessary for the
          security of society. Therefore, justice and punishment are the
          rightful components of law. A punishment must be proportional to the
          violation of justice that is being addressed, the ultimate violation
          being murder, which can be punished by death. Smith also adds that the
          agent who violates justice will undoubtedly experience remorse for his
          action because, once his unlawful inclination is satisfied, he will
          have no choice but to reflect on his violation with the same coolness
          that is exhibited by the society around him. It is in this same way
          that he who acts in gratitude and deserves reward reflects as an
          impartial spectator might on his actions, and is conscious of his
          merit. Lastly, Smith argues that this organization of the principles
          of justice and punishment is useful to society as a means of
          preserving order and security. This, he says, is the work of the
          beneficent and omniscient God who has designed all parts of the
          universe to function harmoniously, much as the parts of a clock do. To
          this end, God has designed our behavior and sentiments to support the
          proper functioning of society. Thus, though we do not always reflect
          on the good which punishment does for the preservation of society, we
          always approve of just punishment -- because, Smith argues, approval
          of just punishment is a sentiment designed by God to sustain a
          harmonious society.
          <br />
          <br />
          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          A potent question here is whether Smith's argument regarding the
          utility of justice actually depends on the concept of God. Though
          later passages of the treatise involve God more heavily, it is not
          hard to replace "God" with "natural selection" here and reframe
          Smith's argument in terms of modern science (i.e. in the passage on
          87-88). If we accept the principle that evolution selectively guides
          human development to enable the propagation of the species, it seems
          reasonable that typical human psychology would be designed so as to
          reinforce a harmonious society. An inherent approval of justified
          punishment could work in such a paradigm. Smith is concerned with
          justice as a negative virtue -- that is to say, as the virtue of not
          acting in a way that injures other people. From this analysis, it
          seems that the idea of being a Good Samaritan would fall into the
          category of beneficence, which Smith believes cannot be enforced. This
          means that bystanders who witness injustice would not be guilty of
          injustice -- a stance which, while perhaps not very controversial in
          Smith's time period, would require significantly more justification in
          a post-World-War-II world. The current state of the world is more
          aligned to the idea that people who stand by and let evil happen are
          also guilty of injustice, though that injustice is not as
          reprehensible as the actions of those who actively promote evil. An
          extension of Smith's conception of justice is the issue of injustices
          done to oneself -- for example, not taking care of oneself, hurting
          oneself, or otherwise behaving in a manner other than what one
          deserves. What actions ought to be taken in such situations? This is a
          more complicated matter than the issue that Smith chose to address,
          because we must at the same time consider the same person as the agent
          and the person acted upon. Moreover, any resentment that the person
          feels toward himself or herself would probably perpetuate self abuse.
          As a result, we would not be able to justly approve of this resentment
          in the way that Smith describes. Such an example appears to underscore
          the limits of Smith's framing of justice. These cases notwithstanding,
          Smith's theory of justice in the abstract is very appealing,
          particularly regarding the balance which he says must be struck
          between direct and indirect sympathy. A practical difficulty here, of
          course, is that people are required to imagine themselves in two very
          different roles -- that of the agent and that of the person acted upon
          -- in order to judge a single situation. This is a skill which
          requires significant practice and even expertise. Again, Smith is able
          to get around this by resorting to the pedagogy with which he
          approaches moral theory: moral behavior is inherent to us, so we do
          not always need to be conscious of how it is working as we act;
          rather, we only need to recognize and agree with the descriptions of
          how our behavior operates, when such proper descriptions are offered.
          This is a significant presupposition, but if it is taken for granted,
          the rest of Smith's approach is solid.

          <h4>Section 3 - Moral judgments on ourselves; the sense of duty</h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          In contrast to the first two parts of the treatise, which primarily
          deal with how we relate to and judge other people, Part III, "Of the
          Foundation of Our Judgments Concerning Our Own Sentiments and Conduct,
          and of the Sense of Duty", addresses how we relate to and judge
          ourselves. Smith posits that the functioning principles are
          essentially the same, except directed inward as opposed to directed at
          other people. One of the most provocative claims made by Smith is that
          if you were to grow up on an island without any companions, completely
          apart from society, you would not be able to effectively judge your
          own actions. This is because morality and judgment are derived from
          sympathy. In order to judge our own actions, we observe and judge the
          actions of others, while at the same time observing their judgments of
          us. In this way, we are able to gain perspective on how we appear to
          impartial observers. This ability to perceive ourselves as impartial
          observers might, and to imagine how our potential actions might look
          to such observers, is called "conscience" (127). Smith refers to
          conscience as the "man within the breast" in order to underscore the
          fact that the conscience effectively allows us to take on two
          perspectives at once: one perspective is our own, dictated by
          self-interest, and the other is that of an imaginary observer who
          judges us from the perspective of a stranger (ibid). Because our
          conscience is always with us, judging our actions, we have two
          distinct sets of goals when it comes to morality: we wish to be
          praised and not blamed by society, and we also wish to be worthy of
          praise and not worthy of blame. Though society may sometimes unjustly
          praise or unjustly blame us, our conscience, the final and fairest
          judge, will always know the truth of whether or not we deserve praise
          or blame. We will always be obligated to live with that knowledge.
          There are, of course, ways in which things can go wrong as far as the
          judgment of the self is concerned. As mentioned above, we may be
          unjustly praised or blamed -- and blame where blame is not due, Smith
          believes, is one of the most painful, upsetting, and shameful elements
          of the human condition. We may also engage in self-deception, may be
          overcome by our passions and go against morality even though we know
          better. Later, when our passions are tempered, our conscience will
          ensure that we feel guilt over such self-deception. Finally, because
          the conscience is developed based on our interactions with society,
          conscience runs the risk of being weak, misguided, or ill-formed if we
          do not associate regularly with impartial people. If we were to only
          interact with our family and to never be judged impartially, we would
          surely be terrible judges of our own behavior. The methods by which
          the conscience learns how to govern us are the observation and the
          judgment of individual moral situations and dilemmas; from such
          activities, the conscience extrapolates general rules concerning what
          is and is not moral. These general rules, taken as a whole, constitute
          what is called "duty" -- a word which fits its modern meaning, for
          Smith sees duty as encompassing the full range of our moral
          obligations (156). He argues that duty was clearly imparted by God,
          because moral obligations have the force of internal laws that govern
          propriety, and because such laws would be handed down by a creator who
          has the ultimate good of the universe in mind. Lastly, Smith adds that
          duty should not always be our sole motive for action: after all, our
          behavior was crafted by God for the goodness of the universe and of
          society. Rather, where we would act beneficently for the sake of
          something we care about, duty serves to amplify this goodness; where
          we would be inclined to act purely in self-interest, duty draws us
          back and keeps us from doing so. Additionally, Smith says, we cannot
          always rely entirely on duty because the general rules of which duty
          consists are sometimes too loose and vague to be adhered to strictly.
          The only case in which moral rules are strict and must always be
          followed is in the domain of justice, as described in Part II.
          <br />
          <br />
          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          It is important to understand that in this description of the
          conscience, Smith is using some of the same methods of analysis that
          he applied to justice in the previous section: though he proposes that
          the conscience functions like an impartial observer, he does not
          presume that we consciously put ourselves in such a position. This
          process, according to Smith, happens naturally and without much
          thought on our part. Understanding Smith in this light can make his
          theory significantly more plausible. This section is where Smith's
          religious angle becomes more integral to his argument, and also
          somewhat more problematic. For example, Smith says that God designed
          human nature to tend towards societal harmony and goodness in
          accordance with the rest of the universe. Yet he also says that a
          human living alone would never be able to develop a moral perspective.
          Smith does not explain why this state of affairs does not entail a
          contradiction. One could, of course, make an argument from charity to
          save Smith's reasoning here. One could say that humankind is meant to
          establish harmony both within and between different social groups, and
          so was created without a preexisting moral code. Thus, human morality
          could grow with human behavior in the most culturally harmonious way
          (even though some fundamental notion of right and wrong is still
          constant to all humanity). This would explain why different cultures
          can all sustain themselves with similar-yet-different moral standards,
          and would also justify the person on an island having no sense of
          morality. An interesting inquiry here would involve the comparison of
          Smith's theory of conscience to the psychoanalytical model of the ego,
          the id, and the superego. According to the latter model, we inherit
          instinctive, societally-inappropriate desires from the id, which are
          censored by the superego, or our sense of what is socially
          appropriate. The ego, our interface with reality, is left to strike a
          balance between these two forces. It is worth noting that that these
          two models, though very different, yield similar results. Though the
          old psychoanalytical school of thought saw basic human nature in terms
          of the id, full of destructive and violent urges, and though Smith's
          model construes people as inherently moral, both models posit that
          humanity's basic nature is censored and policed by an internal force
          -- the conscience, or the superego -- which is formed by an
          individual's interactions with the rest of society.

          <h4>
            Section 4 - The effect of utility on the sentiment of approval
          </h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          This brief section, "Of the Effect of Utility upon the Sentiment of
          Approbation", serves to address the influence which utility exerts on
          aesthetics and morality. This discussion is short because Smith's only
          real goal here is to refute the belief, held by some, that morality is
          derived from the utility of an action in relation to society and the
          individual. First, Smith assesses the way in which utility impacts the
          beauty which people perceive in objects and systems. He argues that
          objects which appear to make their users' lives easier are made more
          valuable by virtue of people sympathizing with the owners of these
          objects; for example, someone might value a palace because of the
          imagined relaxation and satisfaction that such a palace would give its
          owner. Smith uses this logic to explain why people collect useless
          trinkets, enamored with their utility even though these items are
          never actually used (e.g. pocket watch collections). Smith also says
          that this notion of utility is part of the reason why people aspire to
          be wealthy. Smith offers here an argument which is famous on account
          of its later presentation in The Wealth of Nations: people mistakenly
          value wealth because they think it can make them far happier than it
          actually can. This explains where the industrious spirit of
          lower-class people comes from, and also where the inclination of the
          wealthy to increase and tend to their wealth comes from. Yet people
          only have limited appetites, regardless of class, and so the surplus
          resources and wealth which the wealthy require their servants and
          dependents to generate ends up being distributed among those
          lower-class people who helped to produce such wealth. So, as Smith
          says, people pursuing their own interests in this case ends up
          producing the distribution of wealth and security which is most
          comfortable for everyone, as though an "invisible hand" were guiding
          the economy (182). Additionally, Smith says, many patriots act out of
          love of the beauty perceived in the utility and efficiency of the
          political systems of their countries. Because of this, people of
          public spirit and people of humanity often do not understand each
          other, because the former care about efficiency and utility whereas
          the latter sympathize purely with the sentiments of individual
          constituents. For the utilitarian to understand the humanitarian,
          Smith suggests making utilitarians more aware of the efficiency to be
          gained when systems and people conduct themselves in accordance with
          propriety. For the humanitarian to understand the utilitarian, he
          suggests describing to humanitarians the ways in which governmental
          functions and systems are conducive to the happiness of society, when
          they run efficiently. Smith does not believe that it is reasonable to
          conclude from all this that utility is the foundation of moral
          approbation and disapprobation. He believes that there are two
          particular reasons why such an argument cannot hold: namely, that
          morality is something fundamentally different from aesthetics, and
          that utility is usually an afterthought in moral decisions, not the
          driving force behind them. The first point harkens back to Smith's
          argument that moral sentiments are endowed by God: such sentiments are
          different from aesthetic responses because aesthetic objects are the
          products of human design, whereas God designed our sentiments for the
          purpose of the harmonious goodness of society. Though our sentiments
          may, because of God's design, end up serving the utility of society,
          this does not mean that we act morally because of that utility. That
          is the precise error in attribution of cause which Smith discussed in
          Part II, in regard to God's design of our adherence to the principles
          of justice. Smith's second point reinforces this. If we were to act
          primarily out of utility, all reason would provoke us to act out of
          self-interest. Yet we see people act upon the virtues of generosity,
          humanity, and self-control, sometimes even sacrificing their lives for
          others or for the glory of a nation. These observations all suggest
          that we act out of sympathy with society, seeing ourselves as society
          does rather than from the perspective of automatic self-preservation.
          We are compelled to act in response to the duties placed upon us by
          conscience.
          <br />
          <br />
          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          This is the moment in the treatise which most clearly foreshadows the
          economic theory of free trade laid out in The Wealth of Nations, as
          evidenced by Smith's use of the invisible hand analogy. Though Smith
          obviously values virtue as expressed through duty and wisdom, it is
          clear that he has immense respect for the principle of utility.
          Indeed, economic ambition is largely built upon the illusion of how
          useful wealth is to a person, whose needs of security and good health
          can in fact be met without the sort of enormous wealth desired. There
          is much to be said about the economic ramifications of the invisible
          hand idea, most of which is outside the scope of Smith's moral
          treatise. Suffice it to say, the "trickle-down" economic theory which
          this idea suggests (i.e. that the wealth created by the rich getting
          richer enables everyone to get richer) is predicated upon a quality of
          moral decency in the rich. If the rich are corrupt, they will gladly
          horde all the wealth which they generate, and will mistreat those who
          help them to produce it. What's more, as Smith himself says
          (particularly in the next part of this treatise), the rich and those
          of status are in a unique position: they have the public's favor by
          virtue of their class, and can therefore bend the rules of society
          more often and more easily than an average citizen can. Smith's
          invisible hand, while reasonable in theory, seems to put a grand
          amount of faith in human nature. One ought to consider, in response to
          Smith's views on utility and approbation, that there is another school
          of thought, which maintains that people can act in society's interest
          but still be motivated by self-preservation or self-advancement. This
          occurs on a level which is purely evolutionary and is not accessible
          to the conscious mind. This would also be a perspective which an
          updated Smith would probably have to find a way to refute.
          Nonetheless, Smith raises a good point about moral choices. When you
          are put in an immediate moral dilemma -- say, someone you love is in
          danger -- and you are required to act quickly, are you genuinely
          capable of calculating the utility of your actions? Note that this is
          an entirely different matter from whether or not utility is a good way
          of resolving moral dilemmas: Smith is only asking where our moral
          sentiments originate. After all, he believes that all that we need to
          do in order to be moral is to follow our naturally moral instincts and
          avoid corruption. Thus, the matter of utilitarian moral calculus is of
          little concern to him here.

          <h4>Section 5 - The moral influence of custom and fashion</h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          This small but important section, "Of the Influence of Custom and
          Fashion upon the Sentiments of Moral Approbation and Disapprobation",
          addresses two major sources of mental stratification across different
          cultures. In a parallel to his discussion of utility, Smith believes
          that both custom and fashion affect aesthetics. To a lesser degree, he
          argues, they also affect morality. Custom is the association one makes
          between two things which routinely accompany each other. Smith argues
          that this simple matter of association creates a sense of aesthetic
          pleasantness: if one is accustomed to certain architectural elements
          being seen together, these elements come to constitute a style, and
          one is pleased to see these elements all together. Seeing a style with
          an element missing would actually be unsettling because of the
          influence of custom. Fashion, on the other hand, is derived from our
          admiration of people of status. Any particularity of aesthetics which
          these people adopt -- for example, a certain style of dress or
          appreciation for a certain artist --becomes valued by virtue of being
          associated with people of status. It follows, of course, that when
          people of status abandon a given style, it is no longer fashionable.
          Because our moral sentiments are somewhat inherent, they are much more
          resistant to custom and fashion than our sense of aesthetics is;
          however, our moral sentiments are not immune to these influences.
          Where they coincide with our natural moral sentiments, custom and
          fashion only serve to heighten and enhance these sentiments; however,
          where they are opposed, they serve to make us less aware and more
          accustomed to what would otherwise be regarded as breaches of moral
          duty. Smith's words remind us that the conscience is quite
          impressionable -- at times, dangerously so. It is this influence of
          custom and fashion, Smith argues, which accounts for major differences
          across cultures -- particularly across continents. While European
          countries disagree on issues of courtesy, other countries differ in
          more extreme ways: Smith refers to Native Americans as members of a
          "savage" society, one in which people are trained to endure the worst
          tortures in the event of capture, all the while expressing no pain
          (204-205). He similarly looks down on the infanticide which was
          reportedly practiced in ancient Greece. In the case of aesthetics,
          Smith cites one Father Buffier in suggesting that beauty lies in the
          average appearance of things (196-197). This makes sense, Smith
          argues, because the average form is the form most often chosen by
          nature. Yet he concludes that standards of beauty are very different
          across cultures, with none of these standards being morally wrong.
          After all, different averages can occur within different populations:
          the average length of a human foot in England, for instance, is not
          equal to the average length of a human foot in China. Smith makes no
          such corollary for the case of moral sentiments, because moral
          sentiments are designed by God; therefore, they are expressions of
          absolute truth, which is merely distorted by such things as custom and
          fashion. Yet Smith insists that true moral atrocities would never be
          accepted by people, regardless of their cultural dispositions, on
          account of this inherent sense of morality. Morality, he believes, is
          the most resilient part of human nature.
          <br />
          <br />
          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          Although Smith is very biased towards his own culture, he uses this
          section to arrive at a compromise between two overarching moral belief
          systems, known as "moral relativism" and "moral absolutism." The
          former is a pedagogy which claims that morality is a construct
          established and enforced by the norms of one's culture; thus, there is
          no real "right" or "wrong" in an objective sense. The latter says just
          the opposite: there exists an absolute concept of moral goodness,
          which we are somehow able to access and know to varying degrees. Under
          the pedagogy of moral absolutism, all actions have definitive moral
          content regardless of culture. It is clear that Smith is a moral
          absolutist, as is evident from his conviction that our moral
          sentiments are imparted to us by God. (God is arguably the most
          absolute concept which a philosopher can employ.) However, Smith also
          allows that morality is capable of being warped based on culture, even
          though morality cannot be completely destroyed because of its absolute
          foundation. To put the case clearly, Smith thinks that such distortion
          is typically a departure from true moral good, an entirely different
          position from the moral relativist's stance. Yet, unlike the most
          dogmatic moral absolutists, he acknowledges that a culture has a
          complex influence on the moral convictions of its people. Smith
          describes the corruption of morality by custom and fashion as a
          departure from natural propriety. He believes all people have
          inherently moral sentiments; those in barbaric cultures have simply
          had their worldview distorted, like a window that has been smudged but
          can still be cleaned. This section also suggests the basic conflict
          between different societies: varying customs and fashions can cause
          populations' convictions to diverge, thereby creating friction.
          Depending on the degree of difference, this can result in a simple
          incompatibility in etiquette, or a source of violent conflict. Yet
          there seems to be no apparent remedy: as Smith says, what is average
          in nature varies across societies and across parts of the globe. So
          how could one truly reconcile, say, the accepted average standards in
          America and in Russia? To pose another question, do the ways in which
          civilized nations diverge from moral truth resemble the ways in which
          certain aesthetic standards deviate from what is average? After all,
          Smith's language of nature choosing the most typical form of something
          invokes the notion of God's design. If that is the case, then the
          difference between aesthetics and morality would not seem to be as
          great as Smith suggests it is.

          <h4>Section 6 - The character of virtue</h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          In this section, "Of the Character of Virtue", Smith outlines his
          views on what constitutes the proper conduct of a wise and virtuous
          person. He divides the constitution of virtue into two major
          categories: the ways in which one's character affects the happiness of
          others, and the ways in which one's character affects the happiness of
          oneself. The virtue of character which affects the character of
          oneself is termed "prudence" by Smith. Prudence consists of acting so
          as to secure one's health, happiness, reputation, and rank in society.
          Smith reiterates here that it is far more damaging to fall in status
          than it is uplifting to rise in status, which is why a chief concern
          of prudence is security. This is also why it is prudent to be
          satisfied with one's rank, and thereby achieve both security in life
          and contentment with what one has. In his discussion of one's
          character in relation to other people, Smith designates tiers by which
          one feels warmth of affection for different people and nations.
          Regarding people, we are obviously most sensitive to and understanding
          of ourselves; beyond that, we are closest to people in terms of the
          sentiment, affection, and understanding we cultivate based on the time
          we spend with them. We are naturally closest to our children, then to
          our parents, then to other blood relations and earliest friends, and
          with decreasing sentiment move outwards from those relations. Smith
          notes that we are more attached to our children than to our parents,
          probably because we intuit that our children depend on us for
          protection, whereas that dynamic is not present in relation to our
          parents. He also emphasizes that we are most disposed to be beneficent
          towards those who have shown us kindness in the past. This is because
          mutual kindness and sympathy are conducive to security and mutual
          well-being. Regarding warmth towards nations, our strongest sentiment
          is by far directed toward our own nation. Smith says that it is often
          the case with less-enlightened men that they resent nations
          surrounding theirs, a feeling motivated by insecurity and rival
          sentiments. This is not the case with wiser men, who are more secure
          and less paranoid. People are generally more impartial when
          considering nations which are distant from their own, because those
          nations are not directly relevant to their lives. Within a country,
          people are most loyal to whatever form of government or organization
          their society follows. Love of country is divided between respect for
          the established system of government and a desire to make the
          government and general state as secure and satisfying as possible. A
          lack of propriety can cause the latter of these desires to overpower
          the former, causing corrupt factions to form and to distort the
          political and moral landscape with extreme agendas. When factions come
          into conflict, whichever is victorious has the luxury of regarding its
          beliefs as morally justified, and of labeling the losers as heretics.
          In such an environment, true wise men are isolated from factions and
          become outcasts. Smith notes that concern for universal prosperity is
          the domain of God, and that we therefore ought only to concern
          ourselves with acting with propriety in our appropriate spheres,
          rather than wringing our hands over universal suffering. The
          perfection of one's nature comes from self-command. We must master and
          temper anger without overcompensating with its opposite emotion, fear.
          We must also form proper estimations of our self-worth, without
          slipping into the vices of pride, vanity, or self-deprecation. Of
          those three deficiencies, vanity is the least harmful because, while
          one wishes people to think more of one than one is in fact worth, one
          may well be working to raise oneself to the status to which one
          aspires. Pride, on the other hand, only incites anger and resentment,
          because it is upsetting to deal with the upset feelings of of someone
          who falsely believes that he or she is worthy of better treatment.
          Self-deprecation is generally shameful and usually leads people to
          treat you as poorly as you treat yourself.

          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          After five sections that mostly treat morality as perceived by
          impartial observers, Smith here frames sentiments in relation to
          affections, both on personal and political levels. Although Smith
          stresses how crucial it is for a well-developed conscience that we
          interact with many impartial observers, we in fact spend more time
          with people with whom we have formed preexisting relationships. It is
          inevitable, in a theory of morality grounded in the perspectives of
          impartial people, that extended periods of time with partial people
          can pose problems. In particular, as Smith indicates, spending time
          with a homogenous faction can greatly warp one's worldview, often to
          the point where one will enter into furious arguments with anyone who
          is not a member of one's faction. With regard to nations, Smith was
          writing in a time far before technology connected the far reaches of
          the world. Given the interconnectedness we now experience, virtually
          all nations other than our own can justifiably be treated as Smith
          treated neighboring nations: that is to say, those who are insecure
          about their patriotism will fear or resent virtually any other nation
          across the world which is in any position to pose a threat. Similarly,
          the internet allows factions to span national boarders -- a problem,
          by Smith's logic, because even though such solidarity can help to
          start movements, it can also promote homogeny of thought, thus
          exacerbating the problems of factions. A passing consideration is
          that, even though the idea of a parent being extremely attached to his
          or her children is biologically tenable, there are many cultures in
          which it is expected that children will live with and take care of
          their parents in old age. As Smith himself says, virtues other than
          justice as rather loosely defined, so that certain concepts in this
          section cannot be held up to the standards of jurisprudence. This
          example of family habits underscores how susceptible to culture and
          custom the virtues which Smith describes can be.

          <h4>Section 7 - Systems of moral philosophy</h4>
          Summary:
          <br />
          <br />
          In the final section of his treatise, "Of Systems of Moral
          Philosophy", Smith takes a step back from his own theory of morality
          to assess other theories of what constitutes virtue, and of how we are
          able to know what virtue is. Lastly, he considers the nature of the
          practical rules of morality. Smith first assesses those who locate
          virtue mainly in propriety -- in particular, Plato, Aristotle, and the
          sect of philosophers known as Stoics (271). Smith has made clear by
          now that he holds propriety in the highest regard, much as the ancient
          philosophers did. Plato believed in living life virtuously by
          meditating on what is just; Aristotle believed in acting so that the
          principles of propriety are actively expressed; the Stoics believed in
          the expression of propriety through the passive acceptance of fortune.
          (In the case of adversities that indicated that the whole of life had
          turned against an individual, the Stoics endorsed the option of
          voluntary death, or suicide.) Smith's issue is that these philosophies
          are too passively contemplative, and lack the means to explain
          beneficent or hurtful actions, which merit reward or punishment in
          ways that cannot be explained by propriety alone. Smith then considers
          the philosopher Epicurus' theory that virtue consists of prudence
          (294). Epicurus argues that all pleasures and pains are bodily in
          nature, and that virtue entails acting to maximize the former and
          minimize the latter. Smith disagrees with this idea on the basis that
          there are too many pleasures and virtues to be explained solely by
          bodily pleasure and pain, appealing as such explanations may be to a
          philosopher. He then considers systems that locate virtue in
          benevolence, such as those championed by the Eclectic philosophers, as
          well as those of Dr. Henry More, John Smith of Cambridge, Dr. Ralph
          Cudworth, and Dr. Hutcheson (300-301). Such systems are based on the
          idea that the will of God is benevolent, and that virtue consists of
          obeying the will of God -- thus, virtue lies in benevolence. Smith
          says the problem with this idea is that benevolence may be sufficient
          for a perfect God, but that imperfect humans require external motives
          to lead virtuous existences (or existences of any sort). Further,
          Smith says the only logic behind following the will of God is the
          promise of either eternal reward or eternal damnation, or perhaps the
          aspiration of an imperfect, limited human being to obey an
          all-powerful, all-knowing God. In the former case, this philosophy is
          just another way of saying that virtue consists of prudence; in the
          latter case, it is simply a way of saying that virtue consists of
          propriety. Lastly, Smith considers what he calls the "licentious
          system" of Dr. Mandeville, which revolves around the idea that all
          seemingly moral actions are actually performed out of vain
          self-interest (306-308). Smith denies the validity of this theory by
          saying that, even if people act out of self-interest in acting
          morally, the moral motives of self-interest -- love of glory, love of
          virtue -- are not vain, but admirable. Smith sees Dr. Mandeville's
          theory as a disservice to moral philosophy, and as one which should
          never have gained much traction, because it contains no sense of truth
          or familiarity that resonates with the people who study it. (This, for
          Smith, is the only type of proof to which moral theory is open.) Smith
          then considers theories of how we come to understand what is virtuous:
          Hobbes' theory that understanding of virtue comes from self-love, Dr.
          Cudworth's theory that it comes from the faculties of reason, and Dr.
          Hutcheson's theory that it comes from a peculiar perceptual faculty
          (314-322). Smith refutes the idea that our notion of the virtuous
          comes from self-love with the counter-example of sympathy, by which we
          put ourselves in imaginative positions that help us to feel what
          others are feeling. This basic societal action demonstrates that we do
          not, as Hobbes suggests, participate in society purely out of
          self-love. Smith then refutes Cudworth's theory by citing the fact
          that we have an immediate, instinctive sense of the moral content of
          actions prior to applying reason to them -- this is how we go about
          forming the general rules that constitute duty. Last of all, he
          refutes Hutcheson's theory by pointing out that no one until recent
          history had naturally noticed the sensory faculty that Hutcheson
          discusses. Because of this, it seems vastly unlikely that such a
          faculty exists. And even beyond this, approbation and disapprobation
          are extremely sensitive to particular instances and circumstances, and
          possess no unifying perceptual feeling in the way that a color, a
          sound, or an emotion like anger does. At the very end of his book,
          Smith discusses the practical rules that may be set forth regarding
          morality. In keeping with the difference he has already set forth
          between the hard-and-fast nature of justice and the loose,
          interpretive nature of other virtues, he rejects casuistry as a futile
          exercise. For Smith, casuistry glazes over the nuances of circumstance
          which so influence propriety. He believes instead that the entirety of
          practical moral rules consists of jurisprudence, wherein the specific
          laws for enforcing justice are delineated.
          <br />
          <br />
          Analysis:
          <br />
          <br />
          Smith's philosophical prowess is displayed to powerful effect in his
          refutation of counterarguments. His reasoning regarding what
          constitutes virtue echoes his analysis of beauty as the average form
          of something: as Smith says, theories that argue that virtue is
          grounded in propriety, prudence, or benevolence are all appealing to
          us because such theories all reflect true parts of our moral nature.
          It therefore makes sense that virtue is a composite function of these
          three concepts; in fact, virtue may draw in even more concepts, which
          Smith has not enumerated. The piety typical of Smith's time also
          limits his discourse here: for instance, when considering why one
          would follow the will of God, Smith presupposes that it is morally
          right to fear impiety. One may wonder whether Smith's theory, which in
          some places is so reliant on God, could hold its own against
          fully-developed theories which do not presuppose a deity. Smith also
          emphasizes that the question of how we come to understand virtue bears
          no relevance to the actual theory of moral sentiments, though this
          question is fascinating in its own right. I would add that the matter
          of what constitutes virtue also has little bearing on the theory
          itself. Smith has taken pains to define various moral characteristics
          -- humanity, beneficence, justice, etc. -- and the matter of what
          constitutes virtue does not impact how any of virtue's constituent
          characteristics play into our overall moral sentiments. Thus, while
          this section is certainly an interesting read, the reader ought to
          note that it is primarily a discussion of terminology (except for the
          last chapter, which examines jurisprudence). Smith's theory has been
          laid out in its entirety by the start of this section; he is seeking
          only to refine broader moral concepts to better fit the context of his
          theory.
