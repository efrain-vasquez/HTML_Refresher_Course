Such as a brand logo or a navigation bar which actually got its own tag in HTML5. You can add a nav tag in the header. A navigation is a special tag for navigation links which are generally unordered lists. -->

      <!-- Web designers and developers use to just create a div for everything and give them an id but now with HTML5 we structure and organize our content differently. Now we use section tags to divide up the content found in the main tag. It is possible to have multiple sections on the same page. You can have a nav tag inside a section and use it to navigate the section. You can also have form tags inside sections aswell as other tags. The way you divide up content using section tags and article tags is largely based on your intent as a designer or developer or author of the article. You can also have subsections inside of articles to divide up the content found in the article into subsections. An article is meant to be a self contained piece of information. Sections are meant to be logical dividers on your web page or even inside of an article.  -->
