      Audio Files in HTML
    </h1>
    <!-- flac is a lossless compression format music compressed with flac sounds
    significantly better than ph audio files. You have to specify a controls
    attribute when playing audio files, thats how the controls show up,
    otherwise you really wont be able to do anything with the audio file.
    another property you can specify is loop so once the music ends it will
    start playing again. You can also specify the property autoplay to
    automatically start the music once the page loads but most times this is
    annoying to the user. -->
    <audio src="/audio/inconsciente.m4a" controls loop>
      Your browser doesn't support audio files
    </audio>

    <!-- Why are the audio and video tags not self closing? 
    In case someone is not using a browser that doesnt support HTML5 yet. -->

    </video>
    <!-- How did browsers show audio and video before these tags made it so easy? 
    For all other multimedia content all other file formats such as 
    animations or flash or pdf or svg's which are stored as raw shapes inside HTML
    are iframe tag also the embed tag (which is self closing). The third tag is the object tag
    which does not specify source but rather data. There is subtle differences between these three tags.
    Really it comes down to what the provider (such as youtube or google) of the content recommends.
    When it comes to embed object the difference becomes mush more subtler because they essentially
    do the same thing. embed is used much less frequently even today because object allows you a fallback
    text incase your browser does not support an object tag which is rare.
