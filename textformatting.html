    This is a standard pargraph tag &lt;p&gt;, which is the most common tag in HTML. 
    The paragraph tag and the headings tag is styled by default as a block style element. 
    Block sytle elements take up the entire width of the page.
  </p>

  <span>
    The &lt;span&gt; tag is vey similar to the paragraph tag. 
    Span tags only take up as much space as the text or elements inside of it.
  </span>
  <span> 
    The key difference is that a span tag doesn't create a new line.

    The HT in HTML is hyper text which is really just a link to another page. 
    The href is an attribute which is declared inside the opening tag &lt;a&gt;. 
    You may also see an attribute refered to as a property. They are often interchangable but not the same thing. 
    An attribute is specific to a tag, however a property is specific to an element.
    The distinction between a tag and element is a tag is anything between the opening and closing brackets themselves,
    while an element is whats created inside the browser by a combination of whats inside the opening and closing tags.
    An element is what the browser creates from tags and inside the browser an element has a property.
    Where as inside the HTML file the tag has an attribute.
    There is a distinction between the actual written HTML code and how its rendered in the browser will come up often. 
    This distinction is often refered to as the DOM or Document Object Model. It is the browsers interpretation of HTML.

  <a 
    href="http://goggle.com">This is a link created by the &lt;a&gt; tag to Google.com with an attribute 
    href=http:/google.com" declared inside the opening tag of &lt;a&gt;.
  </a>

  <!-- The following code block will cover bold, italics, code, blockquote, small, subscript, and superscript -->
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are two ways to bold text:
  <br/>
  <b>This is bold text made using &lt;b&gt;.</b>
  <br/>
  The other way is by: <strong>This is strong text made using &lt;strong&gt;.</strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <i>
    Italics text made using &lt;i&gt;.
  </i>
  <br/>
  <em>
    This is italics text made using &lt;em&gt;. 
    <br/>
    This way of italizing gives better accesibility, 
    meaning some programs are designed to read text out loud to the blind look for &lt;em&gt; 
    to give extra emphasis to this text. 
  </em>

  <code>
    This tag &lt;code&gt; is used for writting code that is viewable on the screen.
    The font on this tag is different from other tags. 
    Each character/element takes equal amount of space on the screen as far as pixels to help 
    you keep track of where you are at on the code file.
  </code>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The block quote tag &lt;blockquote&gt; has an optional property called cite which normally takes a URL but we can use it to cite the author of a quote.
  <blockquote cite="Martin Luther King Jr.">
    "we must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope."

    - Martin Luther King Jr.
  </blockquote>

  <small>
    The &lt;small&lt; tag just uses a slightly smaller font size.
  </small>
  <p>x<sup>2</sup> = 9, This is n example of superscript using <code>sup</code> tag.</p>
  <p>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is Sulfuric Acid. This is an example of a subscript using <code>sub</code> tag.</p>
  Be careful when writting tags inside of tags to not to lose your spacing and place in the sentence.
