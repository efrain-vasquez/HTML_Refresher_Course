    <p>This is a standard pargraph tag &lt;p&gt;, which is the most common tag in HTML. The paragraph tag and the headings tag is styled by default as a block style element. Block sytle elements take up the entire width of the page.</p>
    <span>The &lt;span&gt; tag is vey similar to the paragraph tag. Span tags only take up as much space as the text or elements inside of it.</span>
    <span> The key difference is that a span tag doesn't create a new line.</span>

        The HT in HTML is hyper text which is really just a link to another page. 
        The href is an attribute which is declared inside the opening tag &lt;a&gt;. 
        You may also see an attribute refered to as a property. They are often interchangable but not the same thing. 
        An attribute is specific to a tag, however a property is specific to an element.
        The distinction between a tag and element is a tag is anything between the opening and closing brackets themselves,
        while an element is whats created inside the browser by a combination of whats inside the opening and closing tags.
        An element is what the browser creates from tags and inside the browser an element has a property.
        Where as inside the HTML file the tag has an attribute.
        There is a distinction between the actual written HTML code and how its rendered in the browser will come up often. 
        This distinction is often refered to as the DOM or Document Object Model. It is the browsers interpretation of HTML.
