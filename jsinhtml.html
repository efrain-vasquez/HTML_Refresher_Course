<!-- Lets talk about workflow. Workflow is how you actually customize the HTML 
both from the perspective of writing the HTML and CSS and also from the perspective 
of how it looks on the web page. If your using Brackets as your text editor you can install
an extension called Emmet which will improve your html and css workflow. Emmet you can write 
the name of the tag and press tab and Emmet will complete the tag for you. 

There are two JS libraries that we can add that will give our HTML some interesting features.
The first is called highlight.js -->

    <!-- The documentation also says this: 
    This will find and highlight code inside of <pre><code> tags; it tries to detect the language automatically. 
    If automatic detection doesnâ€™t work for you, you can specify the language in the class attribute: 
    The pre tag rarely comes up usually inside of libraries.-->

    <!-- This is an introduction to syntax highlighting. This is really helpful if you want to write 
    blog posts about writing code. The highlight.js library is very useful for that. -->
