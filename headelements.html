<!-- In almost every single web page you will see something called a meta tag.
Even though you cant see a meta tag they play an important role in how search engines
and web browsers display page results and mark up. The meta tag has two required attributes,
one is the name for the meta tag and the other is the content for the meta tag.
The name of the meta tag tells the browser or search engine what kind of meta tag it is.

One important meta tag attribute is the name="" it can have a keywords property, it is used by search engines such as google to 
quickly extract some keywords that describe the page. The content attribute contains the keywords which 
should be sepaerated by commas. 

There is also another name tag attribute called description 
which when paired with the content attribute can give a description of the web page. 

Another important meta tag that should also be included is charset="" and  charset="" tells the browser what format 
to use to read the web page a very common format is utf-8. In versions prior to HTML5 you would have
seen this meta tag used instead <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html" charset="utf-8">.
For compatibility reasons you could write <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
for web browsers that are able to read HTML5. 

The next meta tag is name=viewport viewport is 
not in quotations because it is a global variable inside of HTML. This meta tag is very 
important because it is about mobile device support. This is the meta tag that google uses to determine 
a very a very basic level of mobile support for your web page, in fact if you dont include this meta tag 
your web page will be ranked lower on the search engine rankings compared to other web pages 
that do have this meta tag especially on mobile devices. The content for this meta tag is 
content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1.0". 

The title is also a meta tag. So google reads the title
tag as an important meta tag when displaying search results. 

The link tag is another common tag.
With the link tag you will usually see the attribute rel="stylesheet" and generally if it is the 
stylesheet you will see it accompanied with an href="" pointing to the stylesheet usually styles.css
this is how you add a stylessheet to a web page from a seperate file. You can link to multiple css files 
using this link tag. When you do this the style sheet that is linked to last overwrites any stylesheet
that is linked to first so generally you want to add your own custom style sheet at the very end.

Another tag you are likely to see in the head is the script tag which is not a self closing tag.
With the script tag there are two things you can do, you can add JS inside of the script tag
but if you dont want to write in line scripts you can also refer to another JS file using the src=""
inside the opening script tag i.e. <script src="">. The src property can link to an external JS file
and the src property can also link to local JS files.

CSS and JS

The presentation of a web page is CSS. JS is used to handle user actions or interactions with the web page.
When ever you work with data CSS and HTML do not handle that very well, CSS and HTML give us the info 
and show us how it looks and can style it really well but when ever your working with data thats when you
need to work with a more complete programing language like JS in order to really show some data in a way that
users can read.
