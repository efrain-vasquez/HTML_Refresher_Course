    <title>Intro to Forms</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- 
    The tag for creating a form is form tag. But inside of the form tag we need to populate it 
    with certain elements. One element we can use is the self closing input tag, which allows us to input 
    information/data to our form. Since input is a self closing tag it can not have any other tags inside of it.
    The input tag has various attributes which can be specified, for example you can specify the type="" 
    attribute as so type="text" some different types of attributes are type="", placeholder="", value="", etc... 
    The value attribute specifies the initial value of an input. An event handler on HTML is a global attribute 
    that you can add to almost any element. It is especially common to see event handlers inside of forms. 
    HTML provides us the ability to work with events using vent properties such as onsubmit="" and onclick=""
    that we can add or attach. HTML and CSS are not good at handling the logic behind how things work so JavaScript
    is used for this. HTML is like the word processor for writing default text and plain text while CSS is used
    for styling. JS is used to handle the business logic. The default behavior of a form is to reload the 
    page every time a form is submitted. There are certain tools that you can use to submit essential forms 
    like a mailing list even if you dont know JS. One such tool is a software like mailchimp.

    <h1>Form Basics</h1>
    <form onsubmit="alert('Form is being submitted')">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Search" />
      <input type="Submit" value="Search" />
    </form>
    <button onclick="console.log('Useless Button was clicked')">
      Useless Button
    </button>
    <!-- Remember to design your forms for accesibility in the context of a web page. -->
    <h1>Intermediate Forms</h1>
    <form>
      <!-- With a textarea in chrome you should be able to expand it as large or as small as you would like. 
      In the textarea you can basically submit an essay-->
      <textarea></textarea>
      <!-- the select tag is used to create a dropdown menu -->
      <select>
        <option>Chedder Cheese</option>
        <option>Goat Cheese</option>
        <option>Mozzarella</option>
      </select>
    </form>

    <p>Select your favorite Cheese:</p>
    <form>
      <!-- The radio button is for creating multiple choice options. You can not use value attribute
      when using type="radio", the proper way to give multiple choices is with the label tag. 
      There is no way for a label to know which radio button it is connected with unless you connect them
      by giving the radio button an attribute of id="" and giving the label the same attribute using the for=""
      attribute. This is important for screen readers that are used for the hearing or vision impaired.
      -->
      <input id="chedder" type="radio" />
      <label for="chedder">Chedder</label>
      <br />
      <input id="moz" type="radio" />
      <label for="moz">Mozzarella</label>
      <br />
      <input id="goat" type="radio" />
      <label for="goat">Goat Cheese</label>
      <!-- This is another way to create a label but it is not recommended for accessibility reasons. -->
      <br />
      <label>
        <input type="radio" />
        Blue Cheese
      </label>
      <br />
      <!-- A screen readers may be able to read the value of the form submit but it does not really have a detailed
      enough description associated with it. So for screen readers we can add another property called 
      aria-describedby="". This similar to the for="" attribute will accept the identifier of a descriptive element.
      Convention would have it that in general you dont want the descriptive element to be a part of your forms,
      so you would place it outside of your form tag. So you would place this tag outside of the form tag but
      inside of a div tag. A div tag is a standard block element that can accept multiple elements nested
      inside of it. You can give your div an attribute of style="visibility:hidden" so that it will hide the 
      description for seeing users but still keep it available and accessible for screen readers.
       -->
      <input type="submit" value="submit" aria-describedby="cheese-submit" />
    </form>

    <div id="cheese-submit" style="visibility:hidden">
      <h2>Description for submit button</h2>
      <p>
        Pressing the submit button will confirm your selection for your favorite
        cheese.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- To describe images to screen readers, images also have a special property the alt="" property. 
    The alt="" text of an image accomplishes two things, one is accessibility it allows screen readers 
    to describe the image and second it makes your image indexable by search engines. -->
    <img
      alt="aerial view of angel of independence square"
