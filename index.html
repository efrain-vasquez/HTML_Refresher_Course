    <h1>Hello Web Browser</h1>
    <p>
        Hello Web Browser, my name is Efrain and I want to give you some information about HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>Subtitle</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't HTML easy? I'm sure you know a lot about HTML, Web Browser. Especially because you are the one displaying it to me.
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Web Browser, let me tell you a bit more about HTML. We can also do special characters inside HTML.
        <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, to do a less than sign, we need to enclose it inside an &amp; followed by its special HTML character map &lt; finally ended by a ; 
    </p>
    <p>
        &mu;, &lambda;, &delta;, &Delta;, and other Greek characters make for great special characters. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
        Efrain
